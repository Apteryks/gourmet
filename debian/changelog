gourmet (0.14.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * new upstream release
  * 0.14.5 no longer conflicts with newer versions of python-pysqlite and
    python-sqlalchemy.  Relax dependencies accordingly.
  * all patches have been pushed upstream, so they can be dropped in Debian.
    The manpage was forgotten when preparing the tarball upstream, so it
    will stick around for another release.

    gourmet at startup. (Closes: #507382) and python-sqlalchemy >= 0.5.

    made the code compatible with the newer libs.
