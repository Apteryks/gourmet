Windows Version Warning
=======================

**Note that this is an alpha version!**

While the Windows version is basically identical to the Linux version, 
it has not been tested as thouroughly. Also, as some of the components Gourmet relies on
are not available for Windows, some features (mainly plugins) are not (yet) available.
Specifically, the

* Printing & PDF Export,
* Spell Checking, and
* Python Shell 

plugins are currently not working.

Furthermore, there seem to be some errors related to the

* Nutritional Information and
* Unit Display Preferences
plugins, in particular when deactivating them again, and to the
* Browse Recipes plugin.

We're currently working on resolving these issues.
If you experience any other issues, please report them at Gourmet's bug tracking system 
at https://github.com/thinkle/gourmet/issues -- by doing so, you can help us improve Gourmet!
