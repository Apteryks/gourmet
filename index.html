title="Screenshot of Browse Recipes view"><img alt=
"Screenshot of Browse Recipes view" src=
"images/screenshots/small/BrowseRecipes.png" /></a><em>Gourmet Recipe Manager</em>
is a recipe-organizer available for Windows, Linux, and other Unix
systems (including Mac OS X, i.e. via the Fink or MacPorts package
managers) that allows you to collect, search, organize, and browse
your recipes. Gourmet can also generate shopping lists and calculate
nutritional information. It imports Mealmaster, MasterCook and
KRecipe files and exports <abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr>s,
webpages and other formats. Gourmet is <a href=
"http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a> and
uses Python, GTK+ and SQLAlchemy.</p>
<p>For an overview of the features Gourmet Recipe Manager offers,
feel free to browse through the tabs on top of the page. You can
<a href=
"https://github.com/thinkle/gourmet/releases">download</a>
<em>Gourmet Recipe Manager</em> from the <a href=
"https://github.com/thinkle/gourmet/">GitHub project page</a> and
<a href=
"https://github.com/thinkle/gourmet/issues">file bug reports and
make feature requests</a> there. Our <a href=
"https://launchpad.net/gourmet">Launchpad project page</a> will allow you to
<a href="https://answers.launchpad.net/gourmet">seek help</a> and sign up for the <a href=
"https://launchpad.net/~gourmet">mailing list</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="block" id="search">
<h3>Simple Search</h3>
<p><a href="images/screenshots/SearchView.png" class="screenshot" title=
"Screenshot of Search view"><img alt="Screenshot of Search view"
src="images/screenshots/small/SearchView.png" /></a>A simple index view allows you to look
at all your recipes as a list and quickly search through them by
ingredient, title, category, cuisine, rating, or instructions.
Searching happens as you type to save you keystrokes, and multiple
kinds of searches can easily be combined from this same view (so
you can search for salads (category) with walnuts (ingredient)
without having to open a separate dialog. You can easily sort
recipes by clicking on the column you'd like to sort by.
Furthermore, for advanced users, you can search using regular
expressions.</p>
</div>
<div class="block" id="display">
<h3>Recipe Card Display</h3>
<p><a href="images/screenshots/CardView.png" class="screenshot" title=
"Screenshot of Recipe Card view"><img alt=
"Screenshot of Recipe Card view" src="images/screenshots/small/CardView.png" /></a>
Individual recipes open in their own windows, just like recipe
cards drawn out of a recipe box. Recipes are attractively displayed
with a minimal amount of controls and settings cluttering the
interface. From the recipe card view, you can instantly multiply or
divide a recipe, and Gourmet will adjust all ingredient amounts and
even adjust the units to keep them as readable as possible (so that
2 tbs. x 4 displays as 1/2 cup).</p>
<p>Since you often need to refer to ingredients as you read a
recipe, the ingredient list is displayed in a separate pane, so
that you can look at ingredients as you scroll through the steps of
a recipe.</p>
<p><a href="images/screenshots/NutritionalInfo.png" class="screenshot" title=
"Screenshot of Nutritional Information view"><img alt=
"Screenshot of Nutrional Information view" src=
"images/screenshots/small/NutritionalInfo.png" /></a>The recipe card view also includes
nutritional information for your recipe. Clicking on the "Edit"
button brings up a simple wizard that will bring you through the
ingredients in your recipe, allowing you to pick equivalences from
the <abbr title=
"United States Department of Agriculture">USDA</abbr> nutritional
database or enter nutritional information by hand. <em>Gourmet</em>
does its best to choose good defaults as it guides you through your
nutritional information, and it remembers your settings for future
recipes. The nutritional information is not directly tied to the
displayed ingredient information, so you can make reasonable
substitutions and approximations for nutritional calculations
without damaging the integrity of your recipes. You can also tell
<em>Gourmet</em> to ignore certain ingredients &mdash; no need to
waste time looking up nutritional information for every last spice
after all!</p>
<p>Future versions of Gourmet may make use of this information to
allow searching and selecting recipes by nutritional content
&mdash; for now, we just display the information we have and try to
make it easy for those interested in nutrition to enter in their
data as quickly as possible. In the future, we will also provide
more information by default, and we may look for a way to create a
community-generated database of nutritional information and
equivalences.</p>

<h3>Recipe Editor</h3>

"images/screenshots/small/RecCardIng.png" alt=
"Screenshot of Recipe Card Ingredients List" /></a>
<p><em>Gourmet</em> aims to make entering ingredients as intuitive
and painless as possible, while still allowing for powerful
features. Features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A keyed ingredient list which allows searches and shopping-list
generation to understand synonyms (like aubergine and eggplant) and
ignore ingredient descriptions (i.e. to treat "tomatoes, finely
chopped" as "tomatoes" for the purpose of searching and generating
shopping lists.</li>
<li>An intuitive spreadsheet-like editing interface</li>
<li>An alternative, fast form-like ingredient entering interface
(which allows you to easily type ingredient lists without looking
at the screen.</li>
<li>Drag-n-drop support for importing ingredient lists from your
web browser or other application.</li>
<li>Support for pasting ingredient lists in from your
clipboard.</li>
<li>Support for grouping ingredients within a recipe.</li>
<li>Support for calling another recipe as an ingredient.(Note: this
allows you to use a recipe as a menu!)</li>
<li>Support for optional ingredients.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to ingredients and instructions, you can enter
information about categories, cuisines, and ratings that you can
later use to search for recipes. In each case, <em>Gourmet</em>
allows you a drop down menu of standard categories and categories
you've used in the past, but also allows you to enter any custom
categories you like.</p>
<p>You can also add images to your recipe for an attractive
display. Thumbnails will be displayed in the recipe index.
Currently, only HTML export supports images.</p>

<h3>Import and Export</h3>
<p><a href="images/screenshots/Import.png" class="screenshot" title=
"Screenshot of Importing Recipes message box"><img src="images/screenshots/Import.png"
alt="Screenshot of Importing Recipes message box" /></a>
<em>Gourmet</em> includes simple and powerful import and export
filters for a number of formats, including the two most common
recipe formats on the web (mealmaster and mastercook).</p>
<p><em>Gourmet</em> can import the following kinds of files:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mealmaster Files</li>
<li>MasterCook text files</li>
<li>MasterCook <abbr title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>
files</li>
<li><em>Gourmet</em> <abbr title=
"eXtensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> files</li>
<li>KRecipe <abbr title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>
Files</li>
<li>MyCookbook files</li>
<li>Archives (such as Zip Files, Gzip Files, or Tarballs)</li>
<li>Websites, such as <a href=
"http://www.epicurious.com">epicurious</a> and <a href=
"http://www.recipezaar.com">recipezaar</a></li>
<li>Unformatted plain text files or websites (in this case, Gourmet
will ask you to identify ingredients, instructions, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Gourmet</em> also can import ingredient lists from a regular
plain text list, which can be imported from a file, pasted from the
clipboard or dragged onto the editing view.</p>
<p><em>Gourmet</em> can export the following kinds of files:</p>
<ul>
<li><abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr> Files</li>
<li>Recipe Web Pages</li>
<li>Rich Text Format</li>
<li>Plain Text</li>
<li>Mealmaster Files</li>
<li><em>Gourmet</em> <abbr title=
"eXtensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> Files</li>
<li>MyCookbook files</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Gourmet</em> aims to import and export as many common
formats as possible. If you have a format you'd like to import,
please submit a feature request, or, if you're a programmer, go
ahead and start writing the filter yourself!</p>

<h3>Shopping List Manager</h3>
<p><a href="images/screenshots/ShoppingList.png" class="screenshot" title=
"Screenshot of Shopping List View"><img alt=
"Screenshot of Shopping List View" src=
"images/screenshots/small/ShoppingList.png" /></a><em>Gourmet</em> allows you to
automatically generate shopping list from your recipes. You can
easily multiply recipes when you add them to adjust for the number
of people you're cooking for. If the units are convertable,
different units used in different recipes will be added up
correctly on your shoppings list (<em>Gourmet</em> even knows the
density of some common foods to allow volume-to-weight
conversions!). If <em>Gourmet</em> can't convert your units, the
shopping list will simply display both units -- for example, the
screenshot shows both tsp. and cloves of garlic, since these units
can't be sensibly combined.</p>
<p>If you already have an item that appears on your shopping list,
you can drag it into your "pantry" so it won't be included! Items
added to your pantry will be remembered in the future (so you don't
have to manually remove items like "water" from your shopping list
every time a recipe calls for it). However, since the pantry list
is shown next to the shopping list, you will always have a list at
hand of all the ingredients called for by your recipes. (You can
drag an item back from the pantry to the shopping list if you've
run out.)</p>
<p>The shopping list is also automatically sorted into categories.
<em>Gourmet</em> knows the basic categories of a number of foods
(produce, meat, fish), and you can create whatever categories are
convenient for your own shopping -- I use it for sorting out the
basic sections and aisles of my local grocery store and those items
that I get from specialty stores. You can set up shopping
categories as you enter recipes, or you can move ingredients around
within the shopping list view by drag and dropping or using a popup
menu.<br /></p>
