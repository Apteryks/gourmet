  <p>
   Gourmet Recipe Manager is a recipe-organizer that allows you to collect, 
   search, organize, and browse your recipes. Gourmet can also generate 
   shopping lists and calculate nutritional information.
  </p>
  <p>
   A simple index view allows you to look at all your recipes as a list 
   and quickly search through them by ingredient, title, category, cuisine, rating, or instructions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Individual recipes open in their own windows, just like recipe cards drawn out of a recipe box.
   From the recipe card view, you can instantly multiply or divide a recipe, and Gourmet will 
   adjust all ingredient amounts for you.
